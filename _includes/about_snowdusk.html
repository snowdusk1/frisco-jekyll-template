		<p>Hi, I'm snowdusk! I live in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississauga">Mississauga</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario">Ontario</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada">Canada</a>, but I work in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto">Toronto</a>. I love talking about world history and languages. I studied East Asian Studies (Japan and China) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics">Linguistics</a> at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Toronto">University of Toronto</a>. I joined the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JET_Programme">JET (Japan Exchange & Teaching) Programme</a> right after graduation and was placed to work as an ALT (Assistant Language Teacher) in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibara">Ibara City</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okayama_Prefecture">Okayama</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan">Japan</a> for 5 years. I came back to Canada in 2010 and have been working in the financial industry ever since. I can speak English and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagalog_language">Tagalog (Filipino)</a> fluently, and advance level Japanese. I also learned French, Spanish and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandarin_Chinese">Mandarin</a> through formal study, but my skills in speaking them are very limited. I like watching movies, esp. the ones by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Burton">Tim Burton</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._Night_Shyamalan">M. Night Shyamalan</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ari_Aster">Ari Aster</a>. I love <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_music">electronic music</a>, esp. classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_music">house</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Techno">techno</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electro_(music)">electro</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_wave">minimal wave</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synth-pop">synth-pop</a>. You can tune in to my live underground Internet radio show <a href="https://anonradio.net/author/snowdusk/">Intergalactic Wasabi Mix</a> every Thursday and Friday, 23:00-24:00 UTC, on <a href="http://anonradio.net">aNONradio.net</a> where I play mostly obscure/underground classic and current electronic music. I have been doing this since 2015. I am very active on the <a href="http://sdf.org">SDF Public Access UNIX System</a>, an Internet community of UNIX and vintage computer users and sponsor of <a href="http://anonradio.net">aNONradio.net</a>. If you share the same interest, why not join us! It's free to join. Go to <a href="http://sdf.org">http://sdf.org</a> for more information. Oh, and I also love animals, esp. cats.</p>
		<p>I love the outdoors. I also love cycling -- not the <a href="https://www.bikeradar.com/news/humour-tips-for-becoming-a-roadie/">"roadie"</a> or the competitive type though... I am more of a leisure, adventure and functional cyclist. I would usually use my bike rather than my car whenever possible for commuting and for running errands. I enjoy <a href="https://bikepacking.com/plog/what-is-bikepacking/">bikepacking</a> and so I usually cycle long distances and camp overnight in different places.</p> 
		<p>Well, I can't think of any other interesting stuff about me. I will keep updating this page when I think of something more to add...</p>
